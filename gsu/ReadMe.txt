# Generic System Utilities (GSU)
#

The classes defined in this library are generic utilities that 
can be used on any system.  

The classes in this library should not have direct dependancies
on the operating system, but they may have dependancies on the 
Generic System Interface (GSI) library. In other words, the 
classes in this library should not need to be modified in order
to work on a different operating system.
